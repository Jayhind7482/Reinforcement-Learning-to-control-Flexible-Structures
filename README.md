### **Reinforcement Learning for Control of a Flexible Structure in 2D Space**

This repository contains code for a project utilizing Reinforcement Learning (RL) to train an agent that controls the tip of a flexible structure in a 2D space. The primary objective of the agent is to predict the necessary movements to make the tip of the structure trace randomly generated target points within the space.

## **Project Overview**
In this project, a flexible structure, such as a robotic arm or similar mechanism, is modeled and controlled using RL techniques. The agent is trained to move the structure's tip to accurately follow a series of randomly generated points in a 2D plane. This involves continuous adjustments based on feedback from the environment and the predictions made by the RL model.

## **Key Features**:
- **Environment**: The simulation environment models a flexible structure that operates in 2D space.
- **Agent**: The RL agent is trained using reward-based learning to minimize the error between the tip's position and the target points.
- **Goal**: The trained agent is tasked with predicting actions that control the structureâ€™s movement to trace the target points accurately.

## **Getting Started**
